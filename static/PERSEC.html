Personal Security</h1><p>
PERSEC is used in conjunction with <a class='tw-tiddlylink tw-tiddlylink-internal tw-tiddlylink-resolves' href='OPSEC.html'>
Operational Security</a> to protect the flow of information to undesirable or non-essential parties. PERSEC information is information which, if shared or leaked, could cause harm to the person in question or her business.</p><p>
Ask your close friends and family to:</p><ul>
<li>
Always assume that what they post is being seen by the public.</li><li>
Consider turning their default location settings to “off.”</li><li>
Never share <em>
details</em> of your company’s business.</li></ul><h1 class=''>
Examples</h1><h2 class=''>
Fictional Example</h2><p>
Your wife mentions to her friend that you have a huge stock of trout at your warehouse. You are the biggest distributor of trout in the state, she says proudly. Her friend mentions this to her husband during dinner, with their 17 year old son at the table.</p><p>
As it turns out, their son is not an upstanding citizen. That night, your warehouse is broken into. Later, twenty thousand pounds of trout are divided between the son and his partners after pulling off the greatest trout heist in Massachusetts history.</p><h2 class=''>
Real Life Example</h2><p>
The Petraeus Scandal is another example, in which then CIA director and ex-general David Petraeus had an affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. During an harassment investigation by the FBI into Broadwell, this became public knowledge and led to Petraeus resignation.</p><p>
The harassment had been sent from a Gmail account, and upon investigation, it was found that her IP address was being used to log into a second Gmail account. This account was used to leave explicit notes to an unknown person as unsent email drafts. The unknown person was discovered to be the Director of the CIA.</p><p>
While COMSEC was ultimately the issue, Petraeus did not practice PERSEC: his extramarital activities were exposed due to his lover’s indiscretion, not his own.</p></div></div></div></span></span></span>
